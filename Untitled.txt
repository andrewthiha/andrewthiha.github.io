PSP Instructions

Here are the steps to get new PSP games.

1) Download the game you want from https://cdromance.com/psp/

2) Once downloaded, extract or unzip the file so you end up with a .iso file

3) Turn on the PSP and then plug in your PSP with the USB cable to the top of the PSP and connect the other end to your computer.

4) Once you see the PSP appear on your computer (similar to how a USB device shows up), open the folder called ISO.

5) Drag the .iso file you extracted from step 2 into this ISO folder.

6) Once complete, disconnect the cable and your PSP should have the game inside now.
